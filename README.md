# ProcessingPP
ProcessingPP is a library written in C++ for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! Processing PP is free and open-source because I believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
